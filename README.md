NEDS data - aad project
So this project is about patients who were diagnosed with Acute Aortic Dissection when they showed up in the ED. 
We are going to look at the NEDS data from year 2006 to year 2014. We will do a survey analysis, and check how the patients were distributed among the variables. Our most interesting stratum is to see what type of patients died, and who survived. 
The project is done by Dr Salil Deo, and Maher Kazimi who is helping with statistics (under supervision and guidance by Dr Deo)
The cleaned data file is posted as clean_t.csv
